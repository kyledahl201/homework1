# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

Week one homework, due 3/12/2020.

## Process

I began by scanning the webpage for issues.  I first found and fixed broken buttons in the navigational bar. From their I followed the logical flow of the acceptance criteria.  I editied the mistakes and cleaned up the code to the best of my ability, making comments along the way.  With additional knowledge I later would review and edit the code further, pushing each commit to gitHub.  I am not 100% happy with this final push, as I don't like that the elements inside the sections on the page fall out when the browser window is resized, or in inspector, which is how I noticed.  I tried solving this problem with positioning and text-wraps but I could not get it to work without distorting other elements worse.  I don't have enough time to solve the problem fully, as I noticed it too late.


## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
